# Retool server

This project has the goal to become a backend server that can be used with [Retool](https://retool.com/). It uses the following technolgies:
- **Deno 2.0** for the runtime environment
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)** for the NoSQL database in the cloud
- **[Json Web Token](https://jwt.io)** for user authentication
- **ExpressJS** for the http server
- **TypeScript** for all the coding

This project is also a way of learning to use these technologies in the same stack, in order to improve my skills in web development.
